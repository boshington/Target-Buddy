Source code for the TargetBuddy progressive webapp hosted on itsbo.sh/targetbuddy.

This is a simple PWA that I developed in order to help enter and track archery scores on my phone, it uses IndexedDB to store in-progress round scoresheets in the browser cache and then populates a scoresheet which can be submitted to your records officer. 
It also has a sight mark tab which allows you to submit your sight marks and view a table which contains your latest sightmarks and All historic sightmarks can be viewed further down the page. 

I really just developed this to help myself out during rounds, but I plan to release it as a free app when it is ready. 

Note, this app isn't designed to work well on desktop, so don't expect it to :) 

#Thank You
This PWA utilises round information contained in archeryutils, maintained by jatkinson1000 and other contributors. 
Huge thank you to this project for making all of the round data available easily
