Source code for the TargetBuddy progressive webapp hosted on itsbo.sh/targetbuddy.

This is a simple PWA that I developed in order to help enter and track archery scores on my phone, it uses IndexedDB to store in-progress round scoresheets in the browser cache and then populates a scoresheet which can be submitted to your records officer. 
It also has a sight mark tab which allows you to submit your sight marks and view a table which contains your latest sightmarks and All historic sightmarks can be viewed further down the page. 

I really just developed this to help myself out during rounds, but I plan to release it as a free app when it is ready. 

This PWA utilises agb round information contained in archeryutils maintained by jatkinson1000
